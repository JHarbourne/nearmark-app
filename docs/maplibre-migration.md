# Map migration — Leaflet/OSM → MapLibre + PMTiles

Status and runbook for moving the **public** map off the OpenStreetMap tile server
(whose usage policy forbids the offline prefetch we need) onto a self-hosted
Protomaps vector basemap. The admin map (`PlaceMap.vue`) intentionally stays on
Leaflet.

## Status

- ✅ **Done & verified on staging.** `MapView.vue` rewritten on MapLibre GL; renders
  a self-hosted `.pmtiles` vector basemap via the `pmtiles://` protocol. Pins, the
  road-following GeoJSON route line, GPS marker, fit-to-bounds, zoom control and all
  overlay chrome work. Confirmed on the staging URL with real Tollesbury data + a
  Tollesbury tile extract (2.4 MB). Off the OSM tile server → policy issue resolved.
- ✅ **Offline caching — done & verified on a device** (airplane mode: streets + labels
  render). On load the app pre-fetches the whole `.pmtiles` file (`precacheBasemap()`); the
  SW's `map-basemap` rule (CacheFirst + `rangeRequests`, `cacheableResponse: [200]` so
  partial 206s never pollute the cache) slices byte-ranges out of that cached full file. Font
  glyphs (`map-fonts`, `protomaps.github.io/basemaps-assets`) cache on first use — **so view
  the map online once before going offline** to warm the labels. Optional later: pre-warm
  glyphs proactively so a never-viewed area still labels offline.
- 🎨 **Branding on staging** still shows the "London / Nearmark" demo defaults — cosmetic
  (see "Env var gotchas" below); does not affect the map.
- 🚢 **Shipped to production (v1.4.0, 2026-07-10).** Merged `feature/maplibre-offline-maps`
  → `staging` → `main`; `tollesbury-app` and `lgbt` auto-deploy from `main`. Tollesbury runs
  the vector basemap + offline caching live.
- ✅ **LGBT London extract — generated & render-verified (2026-07-13).** `lgbt-london.pmtiles`
  (15 MB, bbox `-0.21,51.45,-0.09,51.54`, data-driven from the 82 published venues + ~1 km
  padding). Verified end-to-end by serving it over Vite range requests against the live LGBT
  data — all pins render on a full street/label basemap. **Left to the user:** upload to the
  LGBT Supabase `media` bucket and set `VITE_MAP_PMTILES_URL` on the LGBT Vercel project (until
  then LGBT falls back to raster OSM). Then do the on-device airplane-mode check.

## What changed

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `src/components/MapView.vue` | Full rewrite: Leaflet → MapLibre GL + `pmtiles` + `@protomaps/basemaps` |
| `src/config.js` | Added `mapPmtilesUrl` (`VITE_MAP_PMTILES_URL`) |
| `src/main.js` | Public entry: `leaflet.css` → `maplibre-gl.css` (admin keeps Leaflet) |
| `package.json` | Added `maplibre-gl`, `pmtiles`, `@protomaps/basemaps` |

Basemap style: `@protomaps/basemaps` `layers('protomaps', LIGHT, {lang:'en'})`; glyphs +
sprite from `protomaps.github.io/basemaps-assets`. Fallback to raster OSM when
`VITE_MAP_PMTILES_URL` is unset (keeps un-migrated deployments working).

## Generating a per-deployment `.pmtiles` extract (run on a real machine, not CI)

Each deployment needs its own small vector extract of its area. Recipe (macOS):

```bash
brew install pmtiles                     # Homebrew core; NOT the old protomaps/tap
# pick a recent build date from https://maps.protomaps.com/builds/
pmtiles extract https://build.protomaps.com/<YYYYMMDD>.pmtiles area.pmtiles \
  --bbox=<west,south,east,north>
pmtiles show area.pmtiles                 # sanity check: bounds, ~few MB
```

Examples: Tollesbury `--bbox=0.78,51.72,0.90,51.80` → 2.4 MB; LGBT (inner London)
`--bbox=-0.21,51.45,-0.09,51.54` → 15 MB. Derive the bbox from the deployment's own
published venue coordinates (min/max lat & lng from the Supabase REST API) plus ~1 km padding,
rather than guessing — that keeps the file as small as the content allows. Host it where **HTTP
range requests** are served (Supabase Storage `media` bucket works) and set the public URL as
`VITE_MAP_PMTILES_URL`.

Tip: to render-verify a new extract before handing it off, drop it in `public/` and run the dev
server with `VITE_MAP_PMTILES_URL=/area.pmtiles` (Vite serves static files with range support);
point `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`/`ANON_KEY` at that deployment so fit-to-bounds lands inside the extract.

## Remaining work

1. **Ship** — merge `feature/maplibre-offline-maps` → `staging` → `main` (deploys to the live
   apps). Before/at merge, set `VITE_MAP_PMTILES_URL` (non-sensitive!) on **each** production
   project: **Tollesbury** now; **LGBT** once its London extract exists. Un-set = harmless
   raster-OSM fallback, so the merge itself is safe even before LGBT has its file.
2. ✅ **LGBT London extract** — done (see status above). Remaining: user uploads it + sets
   `VITE_MAP_PMTILES_URL` on the LGBT Vercel project, then the on-device airplane-mode check.
3. **Optional polish** — lazy-load MapLibre (it added ~800 KB to the bundle); pre-warm glyphs
   for never-viewed areas; staging branding cleanup (cosmetic).

## Env var gotchas (hard-won — read before touching Vercel env vars)

- **`VITE_` vars are public** (baked into the browser bundle). The Supabase anon/publishable
  key belongs here and is safe to expose — RLS is the boundary. Don't use the **secret**
  Supabase key client-side (it bypasses RLS).
- **Supabase key naming:** `anon` (old) = `publishable` (new) = the public client key →
  goes in `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. `service_role` (old) = `secret` (new) = server-only.
- **`vercel env pull` returns BLANK values for "Sensitive" variables** — it cannot read
  them. So do **not** bulk-paste a pulled `.env` back into another project: you'll set
  everything to empty strings. (This was the root cause of a long staging debugging session
  — empty Supabase creds → the app fell back to demo/seed data, *not* a "sensitive vars
  don't build" problem. Sensitive vars build fine; the pulled values were just blank.)
- **Vercel env changes need a redeploy** to take effect (`VITE_` bakes at build time).
- Scope staging vars to **Production** — the `nearmark-app-staging` project's `staging`
  branch deploys to its *Production* environment.
